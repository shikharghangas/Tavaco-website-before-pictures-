      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 2009, TAVACO began as a small, local operation with one goal:
        to provide reliable, high-quality services that customers can count on.
      </p>

      <p>
        What started as a modest neighborhood service has grown into one of the
        most trusted names in the property maintenance industry, proudly maintaining
        commercial and industrial sites, residential high-rises, and multi-unit
        development properties across Durham Region, York Region, and the Greater
        Toronto Area.
      </p>

      <p>
        For over 15 years, TAVACO has built its reputation on consistency,
        professionalism, and genuine care for the communities we serve.
